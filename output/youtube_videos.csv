I Tried The #1 BBQ In Texas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8SIKtStUVM,"there is one thing that people haven't been able to crack the coat of outside of Texas smoked brisket everyone wants it but there's only one place on Earth to get it so the question is with over 25 200 barbecue places in Texas alone which is the best that's my mission today using the Texas monthly best barbecue list considered the barbecue Bible we're visiting the most famous influential places off their top 50 list and will be rating each spot out of 30 total points 10 for salt 10 for texture and 10 for flavor separately there will also be a competition for who has the best sides now this all starts at one of the first Michelin star restaurants in all of Texas Corkscrew barbecue just outside of Houston the first of four Michelin star barbecue restaurants in all of America and we're going to visit all of them a lot of people don't realize that smoking meat is one of the hardest jobs in food but why and who better to ask than owner and Pitmaster will buckin every time a customer comes back you want to give him the same exact experience you're dealing with you know the weather the moisture in your wood that plays a part kind of like a game of Tetris I always feel like brisket is the least forgiving out of all the products too you're basically putting all of your eggs in one basket 18 hours later you're hoping that it comes out right if you mess up your day is ruined or your restaurant's [Applause] [Music] close shout out to the Union Pacific on this journey Olivia tan who just moved to Texas will join us for her barbecue baptism let's taste holy this is incredible are all these places going to be as good as this one they will be better than the places you're used to we love Olivia she's from New York so Texas is here to give her a lesson but she's getting an unfair Advantage starting at cork screw I was going to do the finger test where it folds over your finger I think you can tell that that already passed that test yeah this is crazy this is like texturally perfect you do not need teeth to eat this brisket I've had brisket before and it was nothing like this none of them squirted quite like this one the consistency of deliciousness is across all cuts of the brisket not only are we going to be judging the brisket but part of what makes a barbecue experience important to me is the sides and a lot of places don't pay enough attention to their sides the mac and cheese here excellent it tastes real cheese potato salad it's nice I like the way did this it's salted nicely they have like little chunks of potato and a little bit of mashed potato in there too so you're getting two textures the Kel this is not fair to start off with you got to be careful with COA cuz sometimes it can get too rich you're eating this fatty meat you're eating this mac and cheese you want something that's like refreshing this does that okay baked beans ooh wow often times I see one note it's super sweet in ketchupy these they're nice and mouns they're a little spicy too the beans aren't total mush they've got texture to them overall side experience really liked time to rate we have a brand new rating system we also have a very difficult decision to make the best barbecue out of all the best barbecue joints across Texas this is not an easy feat so let's start with the briskets okay flavor how do you feel about out of 10 one is basically it's horrible five would be mid seven is great eight is amazing and nine is like Excellence I think I want to say nine no half points so it's either an eight or a nine I think eight flavor we're giving an 8 out of 10 it's very high on the scale texture I'm going to give the texture a nine yeah I mean it was literally squirting I think we might have to add a new scale I think I'm personally going to take on the squirt factor and that was a 10 out of 10 scored there were a couple bites of the brisket maybe on the flat side I felt like I could have liked a little sprinkle of flaky salt more salt on there you guys make fun of me for my constant pointing out of things being undersalted or overs saled I'm telling you it's the one crucial element that you add to your food that maximizes your flavor we're settling at a seven out of 10 on Thea all very very powerful High rankings for all these things next up the sides seven and a 10 definitely above average not blowing me away but still good an unbelievable scorecard but can anyone Dethrone this because this isn't the only Michelin spot in Texas and on top of that there's a lot of underdogs that are competing here moving in next up truth barbecue in Houston and number three on Texas monthly's top 10 but when you're doing that good how do you not Let It Go all to your head I think we all want to be the best obviously each barbecue restaurant is like really really good it's like having four GMC Chevy and RAM they'll all get you to the same destination it's really just your personal preference I love that comparison I think it's funny because all of you guys are so respectful to each other I think it's because this job sucks like so we kind of all pay homage in respect to each other because we all know what goes into it holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this setup here is the most beautiful most Immaculate little barbecue setup I've ever seen they load these plates up they even gave us a Smash Burger but I want to be really clear we're just tasting the brisket and the four sides are supposed to taste the brisket is kind of stuck under here that's a fold test so sides potato salad this is a chunkier it's good it's an average potato salad I like that there's a crispy topping wow these are good really nice first thing I noticed is the pasta is actually cooked al dente which I don't know if they just made this or not but I'm kind of Blown Away about that it's really creamy too like it's Saucy Co sace M fresh relaxed not over complicated it's not wet it's like refreshing baked beans wo there's a lot of flavor in it they have a ton of caramelized onion in here and immediately it's so apparent side rating I'm going to give this a give this a 7.5 75 makes sense to me now onto the main star of the show the brisket that's really good guys [ __ ] the salt levels are pretty much perfect I don't know that I can nit that so salt levels it's a 10 I don't believe in 10 out of 10 in anything there is a threshold this is right at the line so salt can be a 10 out of 10 flavor beefy I feel like it's a little beefier than the last one was yeah it was this is more traditional Texas how do we feel about saying an 8 out of 10 as well yeah eight works for me texture texture is great I think this texture is a nine we have an unbelievably high ranking for this I'm almost myself questioning how much better it can really get we have a new leader a big leader truth barbecue showing us the truth this is not the end of the story though we got a lot of places to go to I do think there there will be others in here that could Trump this moving on now look truth and Corkscrew are looking to make only barbecue but the next spot I was a little confused by cuz it has uh chocolate in the name so guess we'll find out about that they make their own chocolate I mean like they're manging and Manufacturing their own chocolate it started as that then they did barbecue to fund that then everyone was like wait a minute this barbecue is great and so we're here to judge the barbecue if I'm being honest it's better than any other Texas barbecue outside of Texas but it really wasn't topping our first two we gave it a total score of 20 the lean was quite dry and the fat was a bit too unrendered for Olivia still a very standard Solid Plate of barbecue that I think most people would love should we move on to the sides of all the sides the col slot top with crumbled bacon was number one but even without the mac and cheese the sides averaged out to 6.5 but if there's one thing I can say about Tas that's non-negotiable carrot sule it's [ __ ] delicious this isn't even in the competition it's not fair to add it I give this carot sule like a 9 out of 10 if you come here and you do not get this carrot sule you have made a grave mistake we're done with Houston but we're moving on to the next location which will be burnt Bean Company outside San Antonio a big Contender because they are number four in all of Texas at least according to Texas monthly there's something I've been asking every single Pit Master do you feel like there is competitiveness or love in barbecue in Texas I'm but love man here in Texas it's a big pond we're big fish and we have our own little regions and at the end of the day we're not here to compete against each other we're here to spread the love of of what our Cuisine is and which is barbecue it's not about being the best it's just about everyone's trying to be the best version of themselves right this place is going to be different than Leonards and anywhere else you go to cuz it's self expression of what you believe is Texas barbecue let's eat food time baby I'm pumped this looks incredible the vibe is great I'm going to go mac and cheese that's super Saucy wow the Mac is great big fan I don't like Cheetos that's my only thing W I mean it's a processed snack I don't want to eat it with real food I'm digging around it and the mac and cheese itself is really good very creamy yeah this one's creamed up and that's important let's try the beans you know what this tastes like to me a childhood memory myom mom is from South Texas this tastes just like aing delicious Frito pie that ising delicious yeah these are really really good moving on to Cole saw every single side delicious excellent we're about like an 87 I think an 87 it's just incomparably good let's just go straight for the brisket damn yeah I just like Zapped my body this is the moist or the fatty it's the most fatty part so obviously there's zero dryness it's unbelievably moist this is the most tender brisket we've had this has got to be like the juiciest squirting in my mouth that just blew my mind but not as much as randomly showed up Gabriel acius I excitedly showed him the channel and he was not impressed with our sub count that many people watch me eat a month too have you watched how they do it back there yeah dude sorry for interrupting no you're good you're good pleasure to meet you thank you guys I want to keep eating this which is nuts salt level I'm going to give it a 10 flavor this is the beefiest most beefing brisket I I think I've ever had this has got to be the best so far they did such a good job retaining the beef flavor that it almost has like an Umami quality to yes they're making like candy out of fat here there was a point where we said okay we're not going to do 9 9.5 9.6 we're not going to do that so many of these are so close that I think we're going to introduce the decimal system welcome to mathematics I didn't go to college and I don't know what I'm about to say but I am going to give this I think 94 is fair that's a [ __ ] huge rating we never give 94s this is weird texture [ __ ] like I mean look at this look that's like Poseidon's [ __ ] Trident going in that and you made me eat this with a spoon and I had no problems I think a flat n is very fair yeah I think so too that makes this the highest rated of one it might stay there by golly there's only one way to find out brother that was crazy moving on now before we head up to Austin Texas to try three Michelin star briskets we have one more spot in San Antonio 2 m Smokehouse led by La barbq Alum s r Jr we have the meat and all the sides we're going to start with the meat first of all look at that that's a good sign incredibly flacid I wouldn't use that word just how Josh likes it that's really Smoky a nice way though see the bark on this is totally different super Smoky this tastes like Texas on a DOT salt levels are good it's tender the lean looks wet this is one of the Jing we bad we then tried the sides the standout being the chichoni macaroni mac and cheese top with chichiron I would put this in my top tier Max that I've had your sides are killing and they're seasoned nicely they're cooked nicely they feel a little bit brought into the future the fact that they don't have potato salad does kind of bump it down pretty significantly I think a flat eight just because of that I'm happy with that okay we got to score this thing flavor we'll start there smoke really nice meaty good it's very flavorful I would say I think it's 85 I would say 82 flavor 83 texture I mean it's splitting hairs but the fat is just a little bit less rendered out and there are pieces in here where you're going to kind of be chewing and suckling down a little bit like slimy fat Parts I think I'm going to knock slightly for it I would say eight I agree eight texture eight and then salt level I think you use a touch the hair salt 85 85 I like that salt 85 I think if you want a smokier brisket a meteor brisket this is where you're going to get it we conquered Houston in San Antonio and after five stops burnt Bean holds the lead in both categories so hold on your heads brother next up is homeown Turf Austin texing three of the four Michelin star barbecue places in all of Texas and the most famous barbecue restaurant in the world Franklin Barbecue and there's been a line every day for years but before we eat we got to meet the most important man in meat history he is credited by many pit Masters as the Godfather of Texas barbecue and making it famous globally I don't even know that we'd be making this video without him Aaron Franklin himself man I started cooking barbecue in probably 02 I thought it was cool I didn't catch the mode that it was insanely hard work built fire cooked a brisket it was awful and I loved it really pretty much that first cook I was like I think I want to open a barbecue joint one day you have like spawned this whole passion that people at home who've never even worked in a restaurant are around with this and now opening places how does that make you feel I've got a habit of not paying attention to stuff like that because I don't ever want to inflate my own ego like and I also don't want any outside influence like I want us to do what we do I want it to come from the heart I want it to be so honest and so pure when we think about like oh well who's the best everybody's putting the same amount of energy into this everybody's putting so much heart and soul into it it's like if we're all doing good we're all doing good it doesn't really matter like who's better I tend to just think of the greater good in that like you know can't believe any of us are still open now before we eat we got a a little drip you know got to look right for the par wow we were met with Incredible Hospitality here this is the most famous barbecue place in Texas that is indisputable first of all never been to second of all have been very skeptical about it overhyped places are a thing I try to avoid and when I see big lines like this I'm like like do I really want to wait in line for brisket like this so we're going to find out where it sits Cheers Cheers this one's just salt and pepper this is the best salt level we've had it's a touch salty but not in a bad way you almost get like a salty crust this is really up there I don't know how to explain it but this tastes like where everything else started like it doesn't necessarily have that meat sugar thing happening but it has like pieces of everything else salt level unbelievably good like literally there's no dryness at all flavor really solid I mean it's beepy it's kind of like everything you really want all right let's try the sides there's no mac and cheese beans know what's happening here the beans are good they're a Savory Bean it's not a sweet Bean yeah it's a very Savory Bean it's almost like a chili It's like a chili bean potato salad your favorite yellow mustard is there yellow mustard in the potato salad yeah the potato salad is real Fourth of July grandma style I knew it I would put this potato salad as industry standard pigment style it's not trying to be fancy it's not trying to be something that it's not I don't think it's like blowing my mind I thought the same thing about this all of these just feel like they literal standard like the starting point of barbecue the Classic this place is not trying to be something it's not you're not going to get an elevated side experience cuz really it's about the meat all that being said we're going to give the sides a solid five because really nobody comes here for the sides they come here for the tremendous brisket salt 10 out of 10 I feel great about that so salt is a 10 out of 10 I mean it's perfect texture it's up there no dryness yeah none whatsoever I think there's a few pieces of the lean you know they're a little dry but like they're still juicy my first bite was lean and I didn't even know that it was I thought that it was a fatty I think I'm going to give texture 9 out of 10 I mean it's basically almost perfect I'm happy with that flavor it feels just lacking in beef and smoke a little bit little pot roasty that's a good way to put put it but in terms of like Flavor though 75 it's kind of where I was leaning 7.5 Franklin Barbecue complete and their brisket moves into third place knocking Tas chocolate and barbecue out of the top five while their sides move into fifth place but next up a big spot Interstellar barbecue with our first Texas wagu brisket and it's also number two in the Texas monthly top 10 and a Michelin star holder for us what I think was the most like gratifying thing about getting a star was we never worked for one we never intended to get one we never thought we would get one what we do here on a daily basis doesn't change because we're just making great food and trying to give people great experiences we're pumped thank you for having us congratulations uh would let's eat okay wow arguably one of the most highly anticipated ones I'm going right in everything here looks really really perfect look it'sing breaking by holding it I mean that's kind ofed up that that just happened wow that's good let's go for the sides while we think about it klaw immediately this is the best col saw we've had wow that's really interesting there's something a little more going on there why am I getting something spicy in there it's a jalapeno vinegret but it's actually seasoned properly with salt a lot of these places just use sugar and no salt should we go in the Mac okay this is it I have been waiting get a mac and cheese that is worth the calories and this is amazing the flavor the texture the crunchy [ __ ] on top I should point out this is one of the few pastas we've had that wasn't severely overcooked it's actually like got some shw to it left I have no notes it's a perfect this going to go I'm I might keep eating it see this you see how this isn't fuing mashed potato finally and I did like the other Potato salads we got but every time I saw it I was like God damn anothering mashed up potato salad this is right up my alley actual pieces of whole moist potato it's soft it's got a little bit of chew to it but it's nice it's waxy but it's also refreshing cuz there's some acidity in there but it all kind of comes down to this cuz this has been a very divisive topic they're very like dark red okay 9.8 out of 10 9.5 out of 10 9.5 out of 10 I could live without the beans side dishes at a 9.3 that puts them at the top of the sides leaderboard and push this Franklin Barbecue out of the top five let's talk about brisket this is one of a few actual Michelin star awarded Texas barbecue restaurants and it's number two on the list theen is nice it's juicy try that piece and tell me if you pick up the garlic you absolutely will my body is beginning to reject meat this is really really nice this is tough I mean it's getting we're really splitting hairs at this point let's just make this simple salt I think that the salt levels on the bark are similar to Franklin's like salted very heavily which I really like I'm going to give the salt the same rating that I gave all my other favorite salt places the place that went max out on salt get a 10 out of 10 because it is at the max it's exactly where it should be texture there's a little more chill a steaky chew not a dry shw I'm comfortable with an eight and then flavor I think the flavor was pretty remarkable almost the meat magic like I got a couple bites that gave me that memory and that is aing Magic memory that deserves a shoot up nine I would say nine or like maybe even like 8 N8 n flavor coming in at an 8.9 powerful ratings really high rankings Interstellar barbecue moves into third place for brisket pushing Houston's cork screw out of the top five permanently sorry to see them go not to mention they were in the lead for first place for sides we have two more Miss spots to go my question is can they beat this one but not until we ran into one more celebrity yo Santa please give me brisket next up La Barbecue my number one spot in all of Austin and like a proud papa I got to see them win a Michelin star this has been my favorite place for a long time but to be honest I haven't eaten here in a long time and I've had a lot of really great briskets so far so I'm curious where this is going to land you might have heard me in the crowd I was at the Michelin announcement if you heard anyone screaming and you're like who's that little girl that's crying for her life like can you tell tell us a little bit about your process how you like to do brisket we cook them for about 3 3 and 1/2 hours and we don't use thermometers of any kind we use our hands we use our eyes wow no thermometer this is the biggest Flex we've had so far zero thermometer we just literally wrapped them in pink butcher paper and then we shut the doors and we cook it for about another 3 three and 1/ half hours we pick it up and if they're tender tender we pull it thank you for for making this happen for us and we're pumped to be back let's eat go for it girl P Sal little lacto fermented interesting this is more of like almost like a spicy Kraut kimchi kind of vibe potato salad this is a riff off the classic picnic style potato salad that's very yellow mustard Ford but it's an innovation at the same time because you've got fresh herbs like fresh dill in there instead of them relying on their cold salot to be refreshing it's the potato salad that's refreshing beans they're stewed with onion I think with a little of meat first black beans we've seen right yeah it's a basic stewed Bean nothing too crazy about the beans I will say that's an interesting choice a lot of these places I felt that way about the beans though this this is exciting this Mac looks crazy it's creamy as that's pretty hard is reminiscent of like mac and cheese you eat as a kid I don't say that in a bad way it's Saucy this is almost part queso part mac and cheese I feel that these sides to me are closer to a nine she's feeling a little differently I think we're going to even this out at an 8.8 very high almost a nine brisket let's talk about it it's the melting fat that's my new favorite thing I've learned is about melting fat try a piece of the lean you'll notice that the lean is actually very juicy this is the best lean texturally I think I agree I think that La Barbecue does in my opinion the best cook on a brisket you have to have a touch and a feel and a skill I think that lady has that really peppery which I love but it's not everybody's cup of tea it might be a bit too much Pepper for me texture it's got chew to it and it doesn't make you feel heavy but it's not dry either so texture nine flavor the flavor is kind of affected by the salt and I do feel this one is missing a little salt so I would love to settle this at an 87 because the salt is missing which brings us the salt I think my body is grateful for for it right now what are we going to call Salt 78 I'm with you salt 7.8 could be better this is still an amazing brisket we have our rankings moving on the barbu's brisket sneaks into the top five edging out 2m in San Antonio and their sides move into second place overall pushing Tas chocolate officially out of the competition and next up we have a major Contender ly and Lewis in Austin Texas this is the place where they say new school Barbecue Old School service and that philosophy supposedly is what earned them their Michelin star so did it change things this Accolade has has been bestowed upon us and we're just trying to live up to it every day I think the main thing that sets our brisket apart from everyone else is the wrapping method we use and we use a foil boat we leave ours open so it gets crispy it stays crispy and then the bottom of it holds just enough juices to keep it nice and moist first the brisket yeah that's crazy it's the meat Magic Moment again the magic of meat is in my mouth guys the sides are kind of an unfair Advantage cuz they're all completely different they didn't have any of the sides that we traditionally have but that didn't stop us from trying them if these sides were in the jurisdiction of mac and cheese and baked beans and all the traditional things then we would be entering it in the competition but because they're not it wouldn't be fair but to me this would be the winner of Sid anyway back to the brisket theen is eating almost like a steak I don't know what to do about this I mean it's soing good I almost don't even know what to say I'm also not even hungry and it's this good I don't want to eat brisket but I want to eat this one they properly rendered the fat out of this but like in a way that didn't lose moisture in the lean no this is my favorite lean I think flavor I'm so afraid to get too close to 10 because people are going to roast me but it's perfect I don't what else to saying 96 I mean it really is the best tasting beef I've had salt 10 out of 10 it's maxed out to me it all kind of comes down to one thing texture honestly this is the best texture one I think I've had and whatever they've done here we haven't seen before it's still juicy and chill in just a different way it's by far best texture texture 9.2 out of 10 unbelievable the highest rating across the board in every single category this is as close to a perfect score I think I've ever given in my entire life might as well be a perfect score L Roy Lewis takes the top spot with our brisket rankings we now have a new leader with an insane 28.8 I was not expecting this at all I don't know why I haven't made it down here and I regret not doing it sooner but the question is will it be able to hold the lead against the biggest contenders of the competition coming up we're at Terry blacks this is one that I frequently recommend to people because it is good barbecue I don't think it's excellent the quality is always exactly the same and look the brisket still folds you know I typically send people here for two reasons the first their food is consistent and the second they never run out of brisket or at least they usually don't it's not necessarily because it's the best or is it the sides are very Baseline experience with only mac and cheese really standing out overall side score 6.5 and brisket was a bit too smoky for Olivia earning a total of 24 out of 30 nothing here is bad everything is delicious and I would be very happy to come and dine here with my family but I will say that any Baseline Texas barbecue is better than 99% of barbecue on Earth period end of story we're not trying to reinvent the wheel it is just the stand great scores but not enough for our leaderboard but now we move on to one of the most legendary places in all of America that literally defined Texas barbecue 1 hour outside of Austin Texas snows barbecue it may be number nine on Texas monthly current top 50 list but it's number one and number three on previous lists but what's more interesting is it's home to what I think might be one of the most unique pit crews in all of Texas if not in the world Miss Tootsie is the original Pit Master she's over 80 years old famous from Netflix's Chef's Table barbecue and now she does everything but the brisket and ribs which co- Pit Master clay took off her plate all this is going on while the owner Carrie Bexley is a a former rodeo clown and coal miners like these guys are Texas incarnate so what happened when the fame found this Saturday only spot when it hit we didn't really know what it hit we knew we had been recognized but we didn't have a clue really what Texas monthly was and being recognized I mean we knew it's an honor but we didn't know but it was an immediate quadruple in business what do you think makes y'all's brisket great we're salt and pepper on everything that's all I have ever cooked with is salt and pepper I'd go by field I've never cooked with a gauge she was cooking before they had gauges I'm nervous because look Miss totsie is a legend she's been around forever but to be honest brisket has been innovated upon so many times what if she can't stack up to the rest anymore I don't want to give a low rating but I must be honest let's taste the brisket I will say immediately looks unreal dude we have another Banger that's a really good one so the fatty really moist like juicy salty in a nice way really beefy unctious the flavor is nice the lean isn't dry it's juicy it's a really really good one look at how it folded over this has to be the wet look at it dripping look how it's steaming and dripping and flopping dude this is exactly what I look like when I come out of the shower the bark is super defined but thin and crisp all right beans traditional cowboy beans but I like that these are a little more subdued kind of a nice break from some of the really strong chilies beans we've had these aren't canned beans the texture of them is really nice co sloth no mayo this is what you call a hyper traditional vinegar sugar sloth it's closer to being pickled than it is being dressed potato salad oh yeah this is probably one of the best potato salads I've had add a barbecue place all right sides amazing I feel like we found another place that's like the standard 87 this is the best version of the standard of what a great traditional barbecue side should be they don't even have the mac and cheese and to be honest with you I'm not missing it after what the mac and cheese did to me last night I'm not missing it either brisket it's definitely has the salt going on 10 out of 10 on salt yeah the salt is maxed out this is like the ultimate melting fat I think text this is kind of Immaculate I mean it was all full of juice it's been sitting here a minute now it's still very juicy text 8.7 flavor is really nice too I got to say they don't even Trim in house and it's this good that's crazy flavor 85 even if you don't live in Texas if you make your way to Texas and you don't go to snows I really think you're missing out on the original heart and soul of Texas barbecue you just can't beat like the generational story and the fact that it's this good it's still is crazy snows unbelievable thank you moving on Snow's brisket moving into third place overall pushing Franklin Barbecue out of the top five a big upset while their sides move on to to a tie for third place an amazing experience as we move on to maybe one of the most old school spots in Texas Lou Miller they've received countless Awards and if that's not enough they've been around since the 1940s and it's still in the same family with the third generation Pitmaster Wayne Miller busy with a job you honestly probably wouldn't expect I feel like a museum Cur half the time but most of the tables and chairs that are in there were put in here in 59 I credit my father he chose to keep everything in its original form it's a classic place they put a lot of love in their brisket Maybe not as much as the sides but to be honest that is kind of old school barbecue overall score gets a five the brisket was a strong 7.8 on Flavor eight on texture and nine on salt overall score 24.8 listen all the ones that are getting high rankings are new people coming into the space with every last ounce of possible effort that they can give they're giving maximum effort these guys are just living their lives I'm not saying they don't care had a chance to like drop their shoulders and commit to the process that they've been doing for decades these other places just fing open like a year or two ago they're doing everything that they can to be better so the fact that they would make it that close knowing that I see that as a positive but not strong enough for our leaderboards still well worth a visit to see a true piece of barbecue history that is in fact delicious Austin is wrapped and now it's on our final barbecue City Dallas but first a quick stop in Leck on the way out and uh let me tell you something it was not fun or easy to get here but we're hoping that eie may barbecue number eight on Texas monthly top 10 is worth the trip according to owners arnest and mallerie Robbins they honestly might not exist at all if it weren't for Daniel vaugh editor of the Texas monthly top list whether he knows it or not actually guiding this whole journey started doing roadside vending one day a week in Tucson we decided to go all in on barbecue and relocated to love but we were just having a really really hard time building our business and one morning Daniel V showed up first customer of the day only customer of the day for the first hour and a half that we're open the next day less than 24 hours from his visit he post a review of our trailer and the minute that went live we had people pulling off the highway and they were like hey barbecue snob just posted about this we didn't even know yall yall were out here and it was a light switch there's no doubt in my mind that that saved our business and then it was in our hands to just make sure that we were able to back up his reval I'm pumped I'm ready to eat it better be a meat Magic Moment what if it's not I'll never return to loic ooh all right first we went into the sides and they were typical uncomplicated barbecue sides a solid six overall but now onto the main event I think the meat is the real highlight smokiness bang this is really good this has one of the better smoke levels it's like a classic lean but a little juicier definitely the softest I can't even pick it up with my Fork look this might be one of the most tender we've had let's talk about salt I've noticed that the fatty part is perfectly salted the lean on the other hand is not yeah I would say it's like a little bit light on salt in places it wasn't seasoned evenly overall salt what would you say I think an AG is fair because it's not wildly under seasoned so I don't think that it's hurting it too much I agree salt eight texture juicy it's different too yeah like this is a unique experience kind of texture on a nine yeah okay I like that texture nine flavor this is perfect amount of smoke it's losing a little beefiness to me with the areas that weren't salted enough but the areas that were salted enough the flavor was delicious not pot roasty at all I feel like the way they melted the fat in here too like very slowly as the whole thing really flavorful I think if it was seasoned perfectly it would be a nine I want to be clear this is an absolutely beautiful brisket because the salt is inconsistent the flavor is inconsistent right like that's the flavor enhancer so flavor is going to get 85 25.5 for eie Mae we came all the way out here and it was worth it moving on while it didn't crack our top five list their brisket and sides were still incredibly solid looking at our leaderboard Austin's M start spots are holding strong ly Lewis leads brisket while Interstellar leads sides but now we head to Dallas Fort Worth no Michelin starts here but arguably some of the biggest contenders of the entire video three out of our final four spots are in the Texas monthly top 10 including Goldies number one in all of Texas at least according to Texas monthly so we're starting our leg at Panther City known for injecting their big TexMex flavor into everything that they do that seems a little risky will the risk pay off the Mac SLO potato salad all very solid but the baracho beans honestly cooked with jalapeno bacon and beer top Contender Bean o damn totally different Bean the person who made these beans like a pork Ramen ton kotu of beans top Contender might be the best beans on the trip overall 8.5 very strong if their size of this good surely the brisket is going to keep up salt honestly really missing for us it was like maybe a 7 out of 10 flavor is unique little heat definitely more than just salt and pepper you know maybe a 7 out of 10 what about the texture something feels off here sadly the lean was is probably one of the driest I think I've ever had and we really didn't love how thick it was cut frankly 5 out of 10 overall score unfortunately a 19 out of 30 not everyone can be top risk at boss but Panther City sides do take some possession here at Fourth Place pushing Houston's truth barbecue out of the top five as we move on to Dane's craft barbecue now listen up Dane Weaver quit his full-time job just to dedicate his life to barbecue they're a dangerous Contender sides look amazing super classic Mac really great this apple slot was surpris surprising little sweet kick so the co sace doesn't have any salt on it but then you get a little bite of Raisin you're like oh that's nice little raisin little Walnut I like it when placees switch it up potato salad big flavor and the Frito pie beans these are the best beans of the whole journey overall sides 8 out of 10 moves them into a three-way tie for fifth but I'm more concerned about the brisket which looks incredible flavor super Smoky which I love but Olivia not so much 8 out of 10 texture leans a bit dry on the bite only losing points for a heavily unrendered fat cap an 8 out of 10 and finally salt almost a perfect N9 out of 10 25 overall I think that this place deserves to be among the best they're all literally the best yeah I mean we're literally eating the best briskets in the world for now we're moving on so we move on to Cadillac barbecue number six on Texas monthly top 10 owner Andrew castalin Cooks Texas wagu brisket just like our first police leader ly and Lewis can they out cook in the game of wagu we're at Cadillac but look at this brisket though this whole plate the second this came out we're like this looks different and yet familiar all the sides we requested but they're nice we have patched chili mac and cheese not just plain old mac and cheese we have klaw which I like the way that they cut this it's fine we got beans with burnt ends a classic potato salad all this feels a little bit more culinary driven it's is a Waggy brisket the lean is supposed to be as good as the moist so we'll see let's go for the lean first okay sides mac and cheese oh my God I'm so happy right now pasta's cooked nicely season nicely not too salty cheese quality is there it's creamy it's fatty KW just more more pickle it's like a sweet pickle almost beans a pineapple in that savory but sweet little smoky from the burnt ends which you pick that up but also the beans are meaty whole potato hang on I will say the potato salad is like a baseline potato salad like they're not trying to do anything too fancy here which I like this is a very like heart pickly potato salad it plays well with all the sides wish a little more salt that's like my only complaint on this whole plate this is a really solid brisket but can these sides top our current leader this the best mac and cheese and the beans are actually the best also we have a powerful side leader sides n five out of 10 that's crazy unbelievable experience okay we got to score this thing most of our contenders today have been using very good American beef but just like looy and Lewis an Interstellar Cadillac is using Japanese American Hybrid heex wagu is that really enough of an edge to take them to the top but I finally made a realization if we're all using different kinds of wood and cooking methods sure like that'll change the product absolutely but if the quality of beef is not there you're losing out on so much now that we have Texas wagu I mean the flavor of this the way the fat melts it's almost like a different animal and this is like really turning it up to what it should be talk about salt it doesn't need any more salt at all so we're going to call that salt a 10 out of 10 flavor flavor is great this also tastes like just salt and pepper it's letting the flavor and the quality of the beef shine oh yeah flavor 9.3 we're almost at a perfect score right now okay one more texture the lean is kind of unique in the sense of it's staky and I think some people would be like oh it's not tender enough but it's so juicy and the fatty part of the brisket is tender just like it should be as a whole this is probably where I'd come back to and be like this was the complete barbecue experience that was my favorite so far this is something unique it's a better bite this has that melting fat thing that happens where you put it in your mouth it has structure and immediately it melts it's a meat Magic Moment texture nine it's going to take a lot to unseat a place like this Cadillac's incredible Little Texas Waggy brisket moves on to third place pushing Austin's Interstellar barbecue beating out a Michelin starred restaurant that's right out of the top five welcome to the top five Cadillac and their sides are our new leader with a 9.5 and we finally head to our very last spot number one on the Texas monthly top 50 is it really number one this journey has been long it took weeks to film this we're exhausted and let me tell you something when you eat this much meat you do not feel good pounds and pounds of fatty Rich perfectly smoked brisket the dedication of not only the pit Masters but Olivia and I we're going to need some sort of like a juice cleanser after this but after 16 stops across the Lone Star State our pilgrimage to find the number one brisket in Texas comes down to one of the hottest barbecue spots out in the middle of nowhere outside of Fort Worth Goldie barbecue but as I stepped in the sunlit parking lot I spotted a lone figure in the Horizon oh my God it was Daniel vaugh the man himself the legendary barbecue editor behind the Texas monthly top 50 list the one we've been following this whole time he's been like a Shepherd to us and finally we're here with him in person to witness our final bite would Goldies truly live up to its title we finally made it to Goldies the final location and the man himself Daniel V is here Daniel thank you so much we literally would not have been able to do this without you I'm excited that you're here and I'm excited about this plate because they make their own bread the brisket looks impeccable Olivia is pissed off because they don't have mac and cheese but that's okay we'll let it slide wow the lean is usually what I'm looking for as far as like judging how well it's done right holy [ __ ] is this Waggy or is it what is this no this is just Prime Beef this is prime yeah people are working with the most expensive fattiest beef they can and I have not had lean this juicy in this tender their consistency is just unmatched how many barbecue spots have you visited I'm closing in on 2500 I just went to my cardiologist 2 days ago and he said I'm doing all right not ideal surviving let's jump to sides real quick potato salad is one of my favorite things on earth I say this too often this potato salad it's perfect this you're getting the sweetness of the onion a little bit of crunch from it it's got a little Spice from the black pepper it's salty it's seasoned [ __ ] perfectly okay col saw no mayonnaise in the col saw which is and there's kale super balanced a lot of the places there Co saw is too sweet and the the cabbage is all wilted all the crunch is gone from it this is like fresh cabbage Chewy from the kale little sweetening he's working hard for col slaw adjectives is Sor right beans these basically are chili beans this is the highest level of it though this colaw is amazing the potato salad's perfect the pinto beans they're very good they're seasoned nicely they're not like blowing me away I would give the sides a 95 I'll give it a 95 Olivia yeah I'll meet you there we're agreeing on a 95 out of 10 on the sides this is a side tie with Cadillac I will say that this col slot is 10,000 times better in my opinion that pushes it over but then again they do have mac and cheese we're missing the mac and cheese I was in love with Cadillac their mac and cheese was so good well hang on we got to rate the brisket we got to rate the brisket so the seasoning is ridiculous it's exactly where it should be it's got the smoke flavor I want but it's not overwhelmingly Smoky when you said that this is the place I was like all right how much [ __ ] better is it going to be this is worth fing traveling for like I would fly back here just to eat this this is the culmination of all the prior briskets this is the final brisket boss yes I got to say I'm I'm surprised yall are saying that because you've gone and eaten like all the best brisket around now personally I feel quite Vindicated salt level 10 out of 10 the bark is ridiculous it's also seasoned throughout I'm not just tasting salt on the outside I'm tasting salt on the inside texture let's go to texture I don't know how you get any better on the fatty texture the fat in between all the fibers kind of gushes the lean to me it's like as good if not better than the other leans that we've had that we thought were the best which was looy and Lewis really good steaky lean but so did this and looy and Lewis is using fing wagu how [ __ ] are they in the competition with a lesser grade of beef yeah no they win this is a 95 on texture especially considering it's a lower grade of beef that just leaves one more element which is the flavor to me this is the best flavor I can possibly remember not even considering anything else my brain immediately goes to 965 maybe 97 I'm going to let you make that decision where does it Teeter over as you were talking about this I was actually dreaming the number 9.7 it was a kmic moment we were having you didn't know about then that puts the flavor at I think possibly an unprecedented like for the whole Channel I don't know that we've ever given flavor at a 9.7 out of 10 total score putting Goldies at the very very tippity top of the entire Mountain I mean we've climbed meat Mountain I'm on top of mean Mountain are you on top of me Mountain unfortunately yes tell them pump we're on top of mean Mountain we fought for this dragged up meat Mountain actually I have gout I think I have gout but God damn it we found the best barbecue that we possibly could have and we couldn't have done it without Daniel so thank you for that unbelievable journey I don't think I can look at barbecue for for a little bit I think I need a break but you know what to do you know where to go next time you come to Texas maybe you should come here [ __ ] we've gone and traveled across the the whole globe we've gone to multiple countries and cities and tried foods from all over the world but this is the first time I feel like I've really eaten at all these places and seen all the stories and seen all the people and I really felt the community and the culture and it reminded me kind of the reason that we do this it really feels like the roots of what we've almost lost in culinary so I hope to see that more and uh I'm happy that we found it here in Texas maybe it was a good decision to live here after all"
I Tested Every Tik Tok Shop Cooking Gadget,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKk421VTXDU,Tik Tok is a place where you can really only do one thing scroll endlessly getting a borderline IV injection of nonstop tform content it seems you can't scroll Tik Tok without being advertised a new product every 5 seconds so today I'm giving our culinary assistant an unlimited budget to Doom scroll Tik Tok uh for a specific goal which is to surprise me with as many random Tik Tock shop cooking products to see which you're worth in impulse by and which are a flop starting with just give me the goddamn I've seen this before I know what this is this is the pizza peel thing isn't that fun playing a little rough there it's not even so much as picking up the pizza it's like let's just slide it off well I want to pick it up anyway Haynes oh this thing is about to break in half it's quivering and people would I don't think that was right why are you doing I'm trying not to look at it's bending thing is waning from the weight of this pizza round two lower the whole oven thank you wow wow it works just get a pizza peel you don't need this you seen what elsea can do theoretically let's say you've got some ketchup some mayo and some mustard this is purely theoretical if this comes off what I didn't expect that to work at all that's scary wait let's do a side by side even picked up the juices that we're sting yeah that's actually insane I mean it's clean honestly I would buy this just to do this 100 times over for that reason thumbs up moving on ah a boomerang I'm really glad that stopped that would have cut my fingers right now this a hairnet is this correct no kind of no I've never seen this in my life let's take a little stroll over to the sink is it a strainer yeah so like if you don't have a disposal so this is going to fit like if I want to throw trash away oh you got to put sticky tape down okay no but like you can strain stuff you could wash herbs and like have them drain do it boom oh is it going to hold this heavy ass thing wow that's actually that's impressive that's kind of cool if you don't have a disposal kind of nice are there sinks without disposals this sink doesn't have a disposal I did not realize that until just now I mean maybe we should just buy a couple of these no functionally it works it's very ugly but I'm going to give it a thumbs up next up we have this thing oh wait I think I know what this is you put chicken in here and you shred it so basically someone who probably smokes a lot of weed was like I could make a big version of one of these and you can put chicken in it and shred it we'll see if that person was right I mean it doesn't really work by holding it down to be honest with you I think we'll be better off just doing this let me give it a better try here it's working to me this required a lot more effort you could literally just do this with your hands with gloves on and just do this and it they'll shred I'll give it like a halfway not quite all the way what do you think this one is Josh there's a tray there's this and this so I'm going to guess this is for some sort of stupid sandwich it's not a stupid sandwich no sandwich is stupid it's a 3 in1 breakfast maker so we're going to throw our sausage and then an egg in here mhm move the sausage here you said to put the sausage here I misspoke what the the eggs should be circular and then that drawer on the front was for a couple slices of bread that you just stack on top of each other in there both of them yep I want you to know that the smell emitting from this is actually putrifying smell in there that's terrible that smells like poop from a butt I'm just going to turn it all the way up which is a total of 5 minutes maximum it does tick like a bomb this takes all the heart and soul out of cooking you know when people say they don't want to cook because the effort you know like the time that it takes to clean and I get that and like this is supposed to be a solve for that but genuinely sometimes you just got to pick yourself up and make something special for yourself even if it's for nobody else there's something special in that too this hasn't even started cooking and it's almost done we've let this RI for well over 15 20 minutes we keep having to reset the timer and it's gotten warm I mean this is raw the egg didn't cook at all oh yeah the toast it's the same this is just a piece of we have a scale I mean I love scales what's special oh I've seen this one basically it weighs the food that you put on here and it's supposed to tell you the nutritional information on it calories protein carbs fat how does it do that it's got to be connected to your phone right you got to look up the food they have an app it's connected through Bluetooth and then we'll click add food food we'll do strawberries 35 G saying that that's 11 calories 2.7 G of carbs hell yeah oh even says it right here and then you can also add that to your daily food diary and it attracts it all for you it does feel a little clunky to have to like input every single individual food that you eat in your body but other than that I mean for a quick snack you just want to toss in your mouth like kind of sick I'm going to give this a thumbs up am I supposed to figure out what this is does anyone know what I'm thinking cut cameras is this used to like carve something or like take out something like you put it inside of fruit and like twist it and pull something out a peanut butter stir well first of all this is almond butter this almond butter is incredibly separated we're going to test to see if this can mix it together is there like a technique to this cuz this looks like it's not doing a very good job you can't really finagle this much cuz there's nothing to hold on to size does matter do you just go up and down or do you turn it or like this is pissing me the off honestly I don't know who this is helpful for I'm struggling with this thumbs down next up we have this thing the defrost Express cuty frosting time nonstick surface special aluminum tray draws cold from frozen food in minutes the way it's described sounds very nonscientific but I know that there's something scientific about this I saw Bill n Science Guy say something about this recently I randomly went to the airport in New York City and guess who was in line Bill and N the Science Guy and I was like I love you and he didn't say anything back and that was uh they say don't meet your Heroes so I guess we just put frozen meat on this in a defrost let's see one Frozen one goes here and the other one will stay on this tray and see which defrosts faster this is saying this will do it in 25 minutes so see you in 25 minutes it's been 25 minutes first we're going to test the one that wasn't on the plate the center is 80% Frozen and the outer 20% is defrosted this one exactly the same the best way to defrost something in my opinion is to put it in a plastic bag get all the air out of it and submerge it in water with a light drip of water going to it that trick comes from Alton Brown and it works really well this is just a big toothbrush oh imagine you're like walking through the hallways of your college dorm yo what in the lord's name is that you didn't go to college yeah I I don't know what the experience is like I could be completely wrong you've never heard that in the hallway cuz I certainly have in some of my apartment buildings when I was younger I'm going to guess this is for cleaning bingo I want the big one oh yeah now we're [Music] talking let's give it a rip dude you only picked this so that I would clean this for you this has been on the deep clean list for a while now it's like kind of working try using a smaller more accurate one oh hell yeah oh well I'll be damn it looks better than when inserted yeah H we should order a few of these I think we should order like 20 but I better never hear this going off and there not be dishes getting clean thumbs up is this a rotary grater yeah this is like what they have at Olive Garden oh my God the suction on this I need to invest in this suction technology who did this all right hannes let's go dude oh Christ oh Christ that's shredded cheese but it was very difficult to do you could also just use a box grater I feel like does that look like something you want to clean hold the handle stationary and then screw this and then pull out yeah what's going on what do you want to do next let Julien this just looks like a bigger greater setting julienne time ow I mean it worked and this is single-handedly the ugliest Julian ever if a line cook walked up to me and they were like hey Jos how does this look I'd be like wow that's crazy I need you to find another job tomorrow morning if that's all right I don't know how to feel about this I me it worked so I'll give it a thumbs up no crinkle cut no we've had enough next up we have this thing now if someone hands you this you might be thinking is this a bald torture device and in a way it is because an egg goes in it and it's made to crack your eggs for you no shell I was really expecting this to not work honestly the only reason you would use this is if for some reason you can't crack an egg if you were in good health this is a complete waste of money just learn how to do it with your hands but if for some reason this is going to help you crack an egg for any reason that you're inhibited to crack an egg then I can see this being a good investment so we'll put it at the 50/50 area good for some a waste of money for others I don't know what this is for I'm going to guess like do something with squeezing something like pressing or forming something like a Patty oh I know what it is it's to make your own peanut butter and jelly sandwich uncrustable you don't have to keep hiding it you're just like like walking in like it's a illegal substance oh hell yeah I mean it basically worked you got a little bit of peanut butter out the sides I think that's mostly my fault they're fire yeah no yeah both of us yeah thumbs up what is this an adult diaper portable toilet I'm going to guess this goes in an air fryer just based off how this looks dude you're so smart it's crazy load her up all right see you in a bit all right we've got a crisp mostly burnt fries I mean I guess the idea is that it keeps your air fryer clean is this safe that was kind of my concern so the irony is like I don't have to clean this but I do have to clean this I don't know I don't use an air fryer enough just say whether or not this is helpful if you use an air fryer do you feel like this is helpful let us know I like it I guess hypothetically you can toss this in the dishwasher and that's much easier than this so maybe I'll even give it a thumbs up yeah sure we're being real nice today what is this I don't know what do you think it is this is a self-heating pot so we put water in here we turned it on to Max and it is actually boiling I'm not really that surprised it's basically like a little induction Bur God damn it Hanes I just want to get the disc in there I get to clean that anyway that goes into the boiling water you got to get the powder in there yeah oh on the ground too yeah lid on and then after a few minutes we have instant Ramen done the noodles are cooked the broth is done it's annoying that has to be plugged in but at the same time it's like how much can you ask for right we're boiling on a wooden cutting board which is kind of cool this thing doesn't look very durable but I think if you're careful with it this is kind of useful like if you don't have much of a kitchen or or maybe no kitchen at all or you live in a dorm this could be a lifesaver I might even use this again I'll just close my eyes when I use it cuz it's very ugly he thinks it's ugly but it's the same color as my shirt it's not about the color it's about the design the shirt looks good on you hes all right this could help a lot of people I'm going to give this a huge thumbs up next up oh this is a corn shucker well corn grater yeah whatever it's a corn kerneler I think this is going to work really well I take that back I'll give it one more shot okay there we go just had to get it started so the goal is you want to go as deep as the corn about there but like it immediately nabs my thumb and I'm being very cautious with it I could see this being helpful potentially if you have really bad knife skills or some sort of inhibition that would stop you from using a knife my only concern is this feels really dangerous if you can use a knife just use a knife to demonstrate all right corn okay pretty simple way more corn evenly extracted here's the knife here's the peeler the corn kernels are more whole you got way more yield this is the peeler this is the knife so you can see see the thickness of the kernel on this one and it was way quicker and far less dangerous I have had some of these that have worked well it's just this brand in particular not great I'll give this one of these what do you think this one is Josh this has something to do with temperature is this like a warming tray this is like kind of like a banquet warming tray but instead of a flame underneath you get a warming pad like if you go to a hotel buffet and it's like heated trays yeah the whole ad is like don't you hate when you make so much food and then it all goes cold before you serve it is that cold food you have for me some hot C all right that's enough we do not need the photo has a rotisserie chicken on it though well then we're going to have to replace one of these buddy which one temperature check at minute zero so our soup is 140 our mashed potatoes are 101 the chicken a screaming 150 and the hot chocolate 146 I guess we'll check these in a moment it's been about 30 minutes so this says the Matt's 150 but it's actually 170 let's see if they maintain their temperature first of all the soup coming in at a whopping 12 four definitely lost some temp our mashed potatoes 122 hot chocolate 130 the chalky went down the mashed potatoes went up and the chicken 123 so for the most part all these lost temp yeah they sort of kind of stayed warm if you do have an oven that's functional I would suggest putting your oven on the lowest possible setting make sure that your container is heat proof tent it lightly in tin foil and leave it in there to keep it warm we have a portable blender this is useful if you're out in the woods which we are there's also a freeway over there you open this and then put frozen fruit in there we're going to put a banana in there too some little tease hate that put her on it turned on earlier today oh okay that's actually pretty sick Vitamix right there baby I mean it's got a Vortex this is really good yeah thumbs up this is really ugly though let's work on the design the next Gadget is a [Music] microwave it's like a steamer vegetable basket it's a microwave wave Ramen Cooker wow I feel like people have gotten by without this for a very long time yeah but wait till you see how cool this thing is seasoning then the vegetables and then the shin black which is the beef bone broth seasoning gently love using the microwave 3 minutes I heard the crunch you know sometimes when you make too much liquid you can strain your noodles out and then pour however much broth you want back in what is this if you're rationing at home do I recommend this product no you could just do this in a bowl you don't need to buy another product if you have a microwave in a bowl you can do this because it's the exact same process I'll give it one of these I've been given another Contraption what is this like modeled after like Squidward's hand okay we have an egg it's not a cracker for sure oh this is the flip a fried egg isn't it I have wondered about these I'm excited to try this I'm going in all right so we'll wait for the white to set a little more and then we're going to give this a little shot you know they gave it just enough room to not crush the Yol I guess this is for people who may not have the motor skills to properly flip I think it's better to learn technique but you still have to do the act of flipping it just makes it a little more foolproof here we go this feels too intimate with the egg like gently caress and then you're just going to and you're going to gently ow I mean it worked I did burn myself cuz I'm not used to flipping that slowly my general thought is this is a single use tool that now you can only pick things up that are so tall you know this might work for pancakes too I don't know I could see being useful for some people I will never use this but you know what I'll give it one of these this looks like one of those things that you use to like check your pulse I'm going to go and say that's not the case because there's like a blade in here look this one's pretty clear this looks like basically a bag sealer I mean this is cool let's try it oh no I opened a bag of chips that I don't want to use I guess I'll use my new bag sealer the wire coil in here is actually cutting the bag I mean it's almost sort of working if I can get it to work again on the other direction it's sealed but not airtight this is basically an open air bag of chips this will go stale anyway it's not really doing the job it needs to do and the coil is so hot it's actually cutting through the bag I'm going to go ahead and say that because this didn't really seal it I'm going to give it a thumbs down next up we have this thing oh that's a blade yo wait hold on I think this is like some sort of a slicer right it's like a electric food processor handheld yo hold on it works really well with the white part of the green but as soon as you get to the floppy bits it it just crushes it in there and minces it yeah there's another attachment help it out a little bit it's so small I mean quarter of an onion doesn't even fit this is an eighth of an onion all right whatever I'm giving it one of these I really don't like it I'm sorry next up this is a fryer that comes with a drain I think this is going to work really well I also think this is it's not that big you can maybe fry a couple chicken tenders good luck frying a whole chicken traditionally speaking when you fry the more space you have to fry in the more even the coloration on the fry the easier it is to fry and generally the more maneuverability in what you fry expands you're going to have to clean a pot anyway if you don't want to deal with it don't fry okay we got hot oil this is a little too hot this is like 370 but it's telling me that it's 400 I'm going to go and see that's not right all right let's pop this bad boy in there and the cool thing is if you're worried about oh my God that's hot as wow maybe it wasn't built so well well anyway the point is that if you're frying something you can close this so you don't Splash yourself with oil that is fun but this handle gets extremely hot also we left the sticker on people are scared of frying they really are that's looking nice okay and look at this boom do your little drip tray it's built in I'm liking this now the only problem is I always like to season immediately after it comes out so if I do this it gets in the oil frankly I don't know how much of a problem that is because I've never seasoned hot oil in my life who wants to clean up a bunch of oil if all you're getting is two hash browns out of it so now I'm going to fry other stuff we've got some Moy watsi mozzarella sticks what why are you laughing I'm tired of Italians yelling at me so I'm trying to pronounce things more properly mozzarella sticks are non Italian well these fried nicely they're crisp they're hot they're really good it works it's not super efficient but I could see this being helpful for people who want to fry small batches of stuff you will have less oil to clean up but to me you're better off with a sheet tray and a bigger pot but also give it a thumbs up next up I think this is like a thermo mix cuz it's got like a main base and then like a blender thing in here yeah so I found out this is a milk maker as in like oat milk soy milk we're going to make oat milk oats in water lid goes on this could be sick boom okay that looks milky there are pieces of Oats floating around in it and then we have a mua simple oat milk okay this is not good I mean this is just like Blended up oats and water in order to properly make oat milk typically you have to let it soak in water and then blend it and pass it through a nutmilk bag or a very very very fine mesh cheesecloth to me you're better off buying a blender because that can do multiple things instead of just this so I'm going to give that a thumbs down we have the portable Kettle I'm going to guess that this is a cup that heats stuff up so we turned this on and we set it to 176 we got some water in here I mean it's hot I don't know if I want to drink from something that heated it up electronically though like I would be worried from like a health standpoint but I mean it's cool all right smells like lemon tea if you're going into the office or you're on a trip or maybe you're on a long drive and you want some tea or hypothetically if you have like cold soup in your car that you want to heat up you could toss the soup in here and heat it up I mean I could really see the usefulness of this assuming there's no health hazard kind of sick it works thumbs up okay I already know what this is immediately this is for making a salad you probably put your stupid Greens in here oh this holds your dressing pop the top you put it in there and then you shake it like a protein shaker bottle and then you have have a little Fork that looks like it's trying to do yoga I worked really hard on finding these blue cheese you don't like blue cheese I don't like blue cheese we don't have to use the BL cheese thank you H okay little chicken protein for a f old nuts and berries and then a dressing no no no you put it in here and then you like you know drive into work and later that day you put it in the yeah I already get that all right here I can help you with that paint's back off listen I love love you buddy can't mess with a man in his salad you know I just tried to mess with you so yeah it worked this one's cool I'll give a thumbs up got you a new knife it's just a knife right yep just a knife it's like the number one knife on Tik Tok really mhm I'm not the one to judge a knife and the reason why is really any piece of metal that has an edge can be used as a knife and there's no amount of money that's going to replace that simple fact that said I like higher quality stuff that's going to last a lifetime based off what this is made out of this looks like it's not going to last a very long time but it looks like it's going to get the job done let's try it it's a little awkward but it works I knew it was going to work before I even started using it if you don't have budget for a more expensive or a nicer higher quality knife this is still going to get the job done I've always said before if you have budget get a nicer knife if you don't get a less expensive knife and ideally one that's big and I like the size to this one it's also $5 that's crazy so I'm going to give it a thumbs up I got to say this one surprised me I was not expecting to have this many thumbs up I thought they were all going to be thumbs down so I guess you learn every day sometimes you can't judge a book by its cover and you got to at least give it a shot that said uh I think I'm going to stick to not buying Products off there personally bye subscribe [Music]
Which Country Has The Best Breakfast?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDxTqo5F600,I'm a believer that breakfast is one of the greatest meals of all time and that's why today I'm on a mission to find the best breakfast in the world viewers from all over the globe submitted their favorite breakfast from their representative countries and thousands of votes later the results are in and we're left with a top 12 that come together to meet today in one insane battle the top four most popular dishes will ever earned to buy while the remaining eight will compete for their chance to move on through the tournament the world's most beloved breakfasts are going to battle and we will find our champion starting with our first matchup Ireland versus the Philippines Philippines with longsilog is garlic fried rice topped beautifully with a generous amount of fried garlic longanisa fried egg our favorite Filipino Chef Christian said to serve with sliced tomatoes seasoned with fish sauce and the commenters in our Filipino versus American breakfast called for achara pickled papaya and separately a dipping sauce made with cane vinegar and soy sauce you know to cut the richness of all that garlicky fried rice and pork next up Ireland with the full Irish Breakfast you've been asking for this for a long time it's very simple black and white pudding bangers rashers baked beans fried eggs Fried Tomato box tea and mushrooms and we even got soda bread served on the side with marmalade and butter we ain't around brother Our Guest taste tester today is David Douglas he is an Austin legend known for trying all of the greatest restaurants and telling people all about it on Instagram and of course Quince vicam director and season Channel taste tester two unlikely competitors the Philippines versus Ireland honestly these are really strong contenders I don't even know where to begin I want to go Philippines I can't even say anything I want to just keep eating it that rice is incredible longan is incredible it's just a great combination of things I'm busting that makes two bust the rice unbelievably garlicky but not overwhelmingly so it's almost more of a fragrance than it is like some sort of blast in your face long Anise is fantastic it's sweet it's salty it's Umami fried egg only makes a beautiful sauce with crispness all the acutron it's wonderful there's so many different flavors and textures and they all go so well together and individually each bite is incredible no matter which component you taste there's nothing to not enjoy it's great when flavor town was founded this is what they had in mind they wanted that garlic they wanted the sausage they wanted these Town members coming together to form a sort of a town maybe a town of flavor you could call it okay I I I Rend I don't even know where to begin with this I know where I'm beginning soda me bread that's what I'm thinking too for me this one has the variety going for it it's kind of a playground for you to dip dive dunk I can't stop eating I keep eating something then I go back for something else it's all great flavors all combined into one amazing plate that I thought would be a bit too much I thought there's too many different components but all of them work really well together even the Filipino one same thing it's hard I'm hard what um this is really hard it's voting Time 1 two three unanimous wow Ireland I'm really sorry it's so tasty the unanimous vote it doesn't represent how close these were for me but I think we all put the slight Edge to the Philippines moving on the Philippines moves on powerfully to the next round to face Mexico but first we head to our next round one matchup France versus Colombia Colombia with arapa conos I've never had this before and I got to say these are two things that I love so I have a feeling this is a strong Contender two pan of sauté tomato and green onion add eggs seasoned taste with salt and stir until soft scrambled served with a hand formed fried white corn arapa crispy on the outside but tender chewy almost voluptuous on the inside and enjoy France with the corant I mean we know what this is right butter and dough rolled into multiple layers and once cut and baked crisp be Airy pastries that make me want to take my socks off and wiggle my little piggies I think we should start with France cuz it's the simplest you can dip them into a cappuccino if you want or eat them by themselves this is a good croissant the butter is buttering nice crispy Airy all the qualities of good croissant and I think a good breakfast as well so crispy part of me does want to americanize the croissant and stuff it with other things the French would be appalled well actually the French are finally evolving a little bit you know took them a while but they're on their way God bless them every laugh I get out of Josh he pays me another five nickels I've got a whole dollar now let's move on to the Colombian dish I like this if you are not from Columbia but you're used to like maybe an egg Andor bacon Centric breakfast it feels new you're so used to maybe like toast or hash browns with your eggs this is a great change of pace if you've never had this before I love this I also love that the eggs are deeply flavorful and they've got some vegetative quality to them it's nice the eggs are great everything that's combined into the eggs really elevates it past to very basic scrambled eggs the egg and the pepper mixture it's really working for me in way ways that other dishes haven't so far it's voting Time 1 2 3 what the eggs are great but you know it's just eggs when you're on the streets of France you're walking down and it's like 5: in the morning you just smell those buttery croissants that hits like nothing else that's why it just takes a slight Edge I have a retort just eggs is ignoring the tomatoes the peppers spices and the so that went into this delicious Colombian meal and that's why frankly I disagree with you I'm in between the two opinions here the croissant is so unique to France and there's nothing else like it so I almost wanted to vote for this but just personally I enjoyed this one more that means Columbia moves on to the next round onto our next match up Vietnam versus Turkey Vietnam coming with fa Vietnam recently did very well in our other video where we were looking for which country has the best sandwich now look although f is popular in the United States it's much lesser known as a breakfast item but we're told by a few Vietnamese Chef friends that in Vietnam it's a way of life lay thinly sliced raw beef on top of your cooked rice noodles pour over boiling hot broth to the beef garnish with Thai Basil sliced onion green onion Little Thai chili cilantro bra sliced beef and finally bean sprouts serve and enjoy turkey coming in with menamin we followed this recipe exactly from a YouTube channel Turkish food travel thank you for that you start by sautéing peppers and butter and olive oil followed with chopped tomato season with salt to break that down cook it down roughly crushed using your potato masher then gently stir in some scrambled eggs and very gently cook till the eggs are just barely set you don't want to overcook this add a little cheese on top optionally serve that with bread and it's that simple what should we try for first this one's giving a lot more breakfast energy for me so I'm going to get in here first that's insane it got really cold outside and this feels like such a nice warming presence this is a great breakfast to start off the day on any day I didn't know how the bread was going to go with it but that soft texture on top of another soft texture wasn't a problem it was just a really good taste whatever that light green spicy pepper in there it's like the perfect amount of heat and also the flavor is a little bit more subtle than a jalapeno you got cooked down concus tomato essentially red ball Pepper for a little bit of sweetness and then you have this green pepper that provides an herbaceousness a little bit more of a vegetable flavor but then there's the egg it's custardy it's juicy it's cheesy I mean it's kind of like everything that you like about many breakfasts in the world in one but it's funny you bring up needing to warm up because we have a bowl of warm fa which I would argue is maybe the perfect item for the winter this is light refreshing I can feel good about going along the day if I had this for breakfast but the menen is a flavor punch I don't know that I would say this is less flavorful less spicy it's definitely less spicy but I think f is all about Flavor they're both good in in their own right what do you think David never came here to taste anything he came here to eat time to vote 1 2 3 wow unanimous I'm not saying that this dish is better than this I'm just saying that this is a better breakfast dish than this I wish I grew up in Vietnam eating Fu for breakfast every day and Associated that with breakfast but unfortunately I didn't and so this eggy peppery bready dish just gave more breakfast energy to me I I couldn't help it I fully agree turkey moves on to the next round onto our final round one match up Brazil versus Australia two places I love but who is going to make it to the quarterfinals Brazil with pow Deo AKA cheese bread I could eat a thousand of these I'm not going to lie you need an oiled hand to get your dough balls separated placed onto a baking sheet baked at 350 fhe until they come out Rich golden and beautiful serve immediately with strawberry jam and black coffee Australia with avocado toast in our recent fast food breakfast video our friend Andy Cooks said that Australia loves and is known for its breakfast so Andy's here to describe the Australian avoc toast it has to be avocado on toasted SOS and a poach dig on top soft goat cheese and a nut seed topping called duer seasoned with salt and seasoned with lemon zist garnished with micro coriander and served with cold smoked salmon on the side back to you Legend Andy we love you and by we I mean me it's funny because this is clearly from Brazil but to me when I think of avocado toast I think of California so let's try one the powder cjo I thought this was going to be heavier coming into this but it's really light it's Airy I feel like I could eat three of them maybe four and this Jam that goes with it is a great pairing I'm not a fan of the coffee I'm not a fan of any coffee but that's besides the point this is great cheese bread and coffee in my head I'm like ah it's nice by far the best part for me is the texture It's like got almost like a Mochi sort of situation where you're like chewing it a little longer you think but you're enjoying every moment of it the jam the coffee sweet not sweet works just like the boys were saying I also like the saltiness that the cheese adds to the bread a lot of breads to me are often times UND salted this is perfectly salted this actually one of my favorite breads of all time this going to be a tough battle that said avocado toast I will say avocado toast is one of my favorite foods on Earth but having it next to the pwed cjo I don't know it's tough It's light and refreshing as well it's in a different way I would not be upset starting my morning with something like that it's a good texture it's a good flavor you know what avocado toast is it's exactly what you expect that's the challenge for me it's like there's no novelty Factor here I'm trying to put my brain into objective mode but it's just saying I've had that before I haven't had cheesy bread and jam before that's a new thing I want to latch on to that now we vote one two and three oh the odd man listen avocado toast is great and most times I would want it for breakfast one of my problems with it is it's kind of just is what it is you get bored of it really quick what I liked about the powder cjo is on its own it's delicious delicious with Jam but think of all the other things you can do with this this is such a great base you know I don't know if I could say the same thing about this it's fighting against something that has like how many components on it this is one the flavors are they're not similar but I'd say they're on like a similar level for me but the texture of the pow dejo is just so much higher for me it's more interesting it's something I'm going to be thinking about later today and you know after youat a couple of them I feel like you're pretty full I feel like I kind of have to work my way through the avocado toast nothing wrong with it I just prefer the Brazil one a bit more moving on sorry to Australia and our man Andy but Brazil deservedly takes the final spot in the quarter final matchups our first matchup of this round is a battle between two heavyweights Mexico versus the Philippines Mexico with Chile kiles this is our top vote getter today we have my Rojo recipe which features guo ancho and sorrano chilies the recipes in the in the description along with an even easier variation using a can of chipot lace we sent this recipe to Chef Alejandra at Estee one of the top Mexican restaurants here in Austin and she gave her stamp of approval she did mention that she tossed the chips and sauce together in a separate Bowl being careful not to oversaturate the chips to prevent sogginess great tip I don't know what to do here because if someone were like Josh what's your favorite breakfast it would be one of these two things you're in a tough position I on the other hand just want to eat food and I'm going to worry about the rest later that's crazy how good that is I would like to be baptized in this salsa I went on vacation recently and for 4 days I was out I had Chile killes every single morning for breakfast unapologetically it is incredible we'll get into this I don't know they're so different I feel sorry for us having to make this decision but I feel sorry for everyone that can't experience what we're eating right now cuz this is incredible I don't know what the to do here I think we got to stop thinking and start writing all right guys 1 2 3 wow this is not an easy decision I thought it would be going into this I thought it would blow it out of the water but honestly I couldn't stop eating that garlic fried rice I couldn't stop eating the longa even though the chil Heil is I feel like flavor-wise was a little higher but this is just such a good balanced breakfast for me it came down to one factor only these right here I couldn't stop eating these if this was on that whole different story despite the chili killes being very good couldn't top that for me the way I looked at it was if I was at a restaurant and I saw both of these on the menu I would pick this over this every time chili kace is everywhere but how often do you see a great Filipino breakfast somewhere so Philippines moves on to the next round our next matchup is the 12th seated Columbia versus our fourth seated India India with masala dosa breakfast varies widely depending on where you are in India but most votes from you went to the masala dosa filled with spiced potato and onion mixture served with a coconut chutney and sambar a spiced lentil stew from South India really tasty wow I grew up with this masaladosa is such a classic it has so many good flavors and different options you can choose from while still just being a light vehicle to eat it's really balanced there's a lot of good flavors but it's not too heavy you can eat that whole thing for breakfast and feel good about it the rest of the day it's fragrant got a little crunch it's got a little chew you have the creaminess of the mashed potato it's a little spicy it's a little sweet the auton on the side just an extra layer of flavor a little bit of hydration to it even though it doesn't need it not dry at all really good and then when you do the dunk now half of the crunchy Isn't So crunchy anymore it's a lot going on and it all works together but it's going up against a heavy hitter will it be enough to overtake Columbia this is a tough pick but it's time 1 2 3 unanimous although the araba com W us are delicious this is just super unique there's nothing in the world like this I could eat this every morning I can eat it every morning I could also eat it for lunch and dinner it's just something that keeps you entertained the whole time you're doing I agree I've done that and it's fantastic you can mix and match what's inside you can mix and match the acont it's a great dish India moves on to the semi-finals against the Philippines now to our next quarterfinal matchup USA versus Turkey USA the full American breakfast this needs no explanation big fluffy pancakes to with butter maple syrup a plate of bacon hash brown and scrambled eggs it's a Timeless staple but is it really going to be able to stack up against our contenders today I love seeing these two dishes in front of each other cuz they're so incredibly different funny enough the American one looks a little anemic just because there's such a lack of color I like that there's like red and green and peppers and this nice rustic bread beautifully in a bowl is kind of telling a cultural differences should we start with this one yeah Jesus David you can eat as much as you want after this we're making a sandwich M I will say there's no combination on Earth that's more more iconic in The Breakfast world than bacon maple syrup fresh pancakes what's more iconic than that back to the menen just to refresh my memory here all right it's so tough cuz these are classic flavors but compared to all the flavors we've had today all these new diverse flavors that I'm experiencing it doesn't hit the same I think I'm getting hit in the head with sweetness and fat which I do love but when you introduce other flavors then suddenly those kind of turn from a bright light to a kind of a gray dullness you know ready 1 two three unanimous again I love both dishes but the sweetness and the fat it just didn't compare to the araceous the spice of the Turkish dish yeah this warmed my soul but this danced on my tongue one more thing look how fast this comes together if you want to make this you need to cook bacon you need to cook hash browns you need to cook scrambled eggs and you need to cook pancakes all in separate pans by the way this is kind of a high effort all that to lose to a one pan wonder and the one pan Wonder moves on a big upset turkey continues its Journey towards the crown with a triumphant win over USA onon the quarterfinal matchup brazils versus England number two England with the full English fry up we've seen this video before all right I have a whole recipe for this and it is that exact recipe except we did include black pudding and bubble and squeak we wanted to keep it OG onto a large plate spoon of generous portion of Hines beans separating the rest of the plate with a sausage wall lay down your eggs mushrooms English bacon black pudding bubble and squeak fried bread finish with brua tomatoes and some fresh cracked black pepper the full English breakfast I'm trying to get everything in one bite that's my strategy here is build up sort of a tower of Babble sort of situation now that guys I will admit quite delicious getting all the flavors together it really gives you an appreciation for all the small individual kingdoms of England that came together to make this beautiful dish probably a lot of people died oh certainly I think that's mostly what I'm tasting here he had the experience of putting everything together and having a great time I had a great time having everything separate and it's just as good there's a lot of components on here I didn't really touch the beans but everything else on here is really good individually and I keep coming back I think that says a lot about this dish I'm one of the most indecisive eaters you'll ever meet anytime I go to restaurant I will order almost everything off of the menu that may seem gluttonous but the funny thing is it's not so much about volume of eating it's more so volume of choices and what I love about an English breakfast is it has many textures and flavors and proteins and carbs and starches and crispy and chewy and fatty and juicy and so on and so forth if I'm going out to breakfast and I order this I don't need to order anything else I live in fear that my tower of English breakfast will be the best thing I've had today and nothing else will be able to compare but that's something I'm just going to have to live with unless we find something better could be Brazil one two three unanimous I mean it's not really a Fair competition the pow cjo originally up against the avocado toast was the simple one over the complicated but in this case the complicated one because of the variety of choice and it was all delicious I'm so happy with this I feel like I could eat this every day it goes to show you just when you think you've got it figured out you don't true on to the next and England takes our final spot in the semifinals now it's getting serious with only two more matchups until our final round starting here with the Philippines versus India we are now in the semifinals with two incredibly beautiful unique breakfasts totally different from any American breakfast I think we just need to refresh oursel here it's going to be so hard to beat that India this is a crazy matchup they're both flavor powerhouses I really thought this would be a matter of which one do I want to keep eating but unfortunately both of them I want to keep eating it's also tough to compare cuz they're really so different this one has more sweetness more fragrance this one has all the spices and aromatics and they both have a ton of textures too they're so different and one and the same at the same time all right I have my answer whoever wins this could win the whole thing one two 3 waa India it was a great journey and I really feel like it had a chance to win the whole thing but for now we move on to our semi-final round England versus Turkey England you have a lot of opportunity to win here because you've got eight plus elements the Minimon has two the dish and the bread let's begin back to the Menan this is tough I feel like the texture bar is a lot higher on the English breakfast but the flavor bar is a bit higher on the turkey breakfast I feel like the flavor on the English breakfast it has a ceiling but there is a lot to love about the English breakfast I'm definitely feeling the fact that we're getting into the finals rounds here and this is becoming a lot more difficult just remember whatever you choose don't worry you're probably going to disappoint a whole culture if you have an immigrant parent you're used to that 1 2 three Oh I thought it was going to be another Clean Sweep for turkey the only reason I chose the England one was simply because there are more combinations on this plate and you're going to scoop this bread in there 30 or 40 times until you're done at some point it's just going to be the same thing over and over and over that will not happen with this and here's the kicker this was the thing that really sold me the brua tomatoes provide the same effect that this does if you take these Tomatoes the eggs mix them together and put it on toast now I'm not saying the flavors are the same but just texturally a little bit of tomatoey sweetness some egg you can get almost there I think I see what you're saying for me this is like an amusement park I'm dipping I'm diving I'm combining things in different ways which is great but for this I'm just going on the same roller coaster again and again but it's the one that goes the fastest goes the highest comes crashing down with the peppers and it turns out I'm an adrenaline junkie when it comes to breakfast as I said before there's I think a bar to where the flavor can go on this one at a certain point it hits a limit and this one it just keeps going it keeps building and I don't get bored of it granted it's like one of the first times I've had it but I think I'm going to want it again over and over and over this has now become one of my favorite breakfast dish it's a sleeper and I think it deserves its top spot and there it is turkey medaman battled its way all through and takes its rightful place in the final match up against the Philippines we have two underdogs these were some of the least voted for dishes and yet both of them made it to the finals I'm going to get in here first I give some an examination to that now the Mena men all right I have my answer you guys take as long as you need Roo's trying to hit his minimum caloric requirement today as soon as possible oh my God this does not help you make a decision whatsoever does it now that I've gone into the depths of my piggy nature I know what I need to do 1 2 3 oh my God the wind goes to the Philippines for the best breakfast so many different cultures so many different ingredients Philippines got a deserved wind it climbed all the way from the bottom all the way to the top just like turkey did which was a very very close second I feasted on both of these meals and only one dish had pork and it was sweet pork with garlic rice with pickles and all those Sensations despite how good the dish from Turkey was despite me loving every minute of eating it I had to give it to the Philippines there's a winner here but I think the real winners are us both of these are fantastic dishes every dish we had was incredible really hard decision to make but at the end I just had to give Philippines that slight Edge because the flavor the texture combination was just that much higher but I'm not disappointed at all in our second place Choice there are many other breakfasts out there maybe there is one better than this but we went off the list that we got from you guys so thank you for that thank you for voting congratulations to the Philippines for best breakfast bye subscribe n
