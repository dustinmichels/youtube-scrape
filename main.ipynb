       "\"Bakers across the world practiced the ancient art of creating the perfect croissant luxurious layers of buttery perfumed dough Crispy Crunchy dark brown exterior it's like a bakery swan song But even after over a 100 Years of making Grant does Perfection actually exist which brings me here Paris today I'm on a mission to visit the most influential bakeries in Paris to find arguably the best croissant in the world so to begin we've divided this into three categories the most popular bakeries local Legends and finally modern reinventions but most important whichever all butter croissant is the best tasting will win the overall competition for best classic croissant if there's going to be a place where the perfect croissant exists it's going to be here we're not doing this alone though we need a little bit of help from Adriana she's a Paris croissant expert she's eaten every noteworthy croissant across Paris while running tours here for eating Europe it's actually one of the top food tour companies on the continent no big deal she selected the best croissants from 20 of the top bakeries and pastry shops all over Paris we have a big task ahead of us less talking more eating now for our first stop we're at maon lisabel one of your favorite places if I'm not mistaken when you approach the bakery you can smell the butter in the air which is amazing so this is an awarded cresant there's the best ceson competition taking place in Paris every year and Isabelle won it in 2018 when she opened the bakery what are the guidelines for winning best croissant in Paris so of course they will judge it first after the shape the aspect the regularity but there's the flakiness the chewiness and then melt in the M taste but then you also want it to be like very buttery and very flavorful the smell toasted butter brown butter salt toasted wheat it really smells incredible so cheers it's a nice way to start a day right so all the guidelines that I'm judging this off of exact same as how they're judging it I'm also adding the additional element of like how does the honeycomb structure look immediately you can see it is beautiful super classic but here's the thing if you're used to see any croissant in America this is very different the first thing you experience is the crunch it's a very wispy crispy crunch it's crazy and then the inside super soft luxurious it instantaneously melts in your mouth it's buttery it's rich and it's nicely seasoned with a little bit of sweetness at the end very nice I'm going to give that an 8.5 out of 10 for a Stars category and classic croissant it's a twofer we're starting up here I don't even know how it can go up it's either just going to stay up here or it goes down and I don't expect that to happen so moving on our first croissant of the day and I unfortunately ate the whole thing you know and we only have like over 20 croissants more to go so I'm going to need to start pacing myself here the next one isn't just a big star in France there are other things that are big here at Philipe Kini what we are tasting here is one of the world's largest croissants arguably the largest arguably the only one of the most famous chefs and pastry chefs in Paris the first chef to bake a monolith of a croissant that weighs one whole kilo with this giant croissant he really wanted to preserve the quality and make sure that the croissant still pleases the parisan paletes well we'll see I'm going to treat this croissant like any other croissant it just happens to be extremely big this is so big that I can't hear my right ear talking it's blocking the sound waves I don't know who this dude is I'm showing it off now there's crunch not as much as I would like making something this big usually means that you have to decline on quality I was so shocked that it was still quite good despite its enormous size that said I think in terms of like deliciousness and quality of just the croissant it's like a 6.5 out of 10 it's above average but in terms of experience it's a 9.5 out of 10 I mean look at this thing you have to go here if you're in Paris you have to try this now I need to figure out what to do with the rest of this moving on to a big one panad one of Adriana's favorite spots and apparently a big treat for me she says Chef marijan is an expert at both classic and reinvented croissants you in the good place the best croissant in town did you already see this look at the glass amazing wonderful like me this one wow this is with raspberry J Rasberry you broke it oh oh Joshua turn oh my God oh my God this is a 10 out of 10 experience first up reinvention his by color Ras raspberry jam filled croissant I mean look at this thing unbelievable the raspberry jam isn't overly sweet it tastes like very natural raspberry puree it's excellent and it also doesn't hide the fact that the corant still has its buttery quality look look look look what the camera do so now it's your turn tell them tell them but let's not forget the most important thing the classic oh this is the best honeycomb structure we have seen I think ever I mean it's literally perfect what kind of butter are you using in this this one you know Al the best wow wow wow so soft but the exterior holds its crispiness The inside's Buttery well seasoned the dough is very nice M found our best one two amazing croissants truly a hard decision I love Chef marijana he's so sweet honestly I want to be his best friend so this raspberry croissant let me tell you something this is a reinvention but it was so incredible this is a big n out of 10 we now have a reinvention leader now look it's a reinvented croissant it can win that category but I'm also worried about the overall competition for best classic so maybe this one will take the lead this croissant was incredible classic yet new everything you want in a croissant and a little bit more I think this deserves a powerful 8.9 out of 10 making this the New Classic lead but we're just getting started and if this is an 8.9 could we find a possible 10 out of 10 moving on so now our stop it's called pan it's a three generations family-owned business since 1932 what's special about the ceson that you're going to taste here is one it's still shaped in a c and moon shape and it's banked in a Woodfire so what's the difference between the crescent and the straight shape Crescent shape used to be a sign that is made with margarine and we called it the ordinary Cresent but nowadays most people would use butter and it's a lot easier to just like keep it strain this place is incredibly historic for a specific reason which is why I'm excited to meet the owner at Bonia to learn about one of the oldest functional ovens I mean literally a piece of History not fueled by gas not fueled by Electric but fueled by wood fire we've been here since 1932 so we've developed our bread baking tradition with this for the quasons and theas not necessarily the easiest you're baking those in here too we bake everything in here so we bake the bread the pastries the cookies and the vinois and the difficulty is of course that there variations in the way the the oven reacts this has got to be one of the only if not the only one left by and large people are not very excited about using this cuz it is more work and more attention right but the difference and flavors is pretty incredible too I can smell the difference in the bake borderline smokey fresh Woodfire smell campf firy but it's also buttery toasted butter she said she likes to eat the little Parts first so I'll start with that so the end piece nice and crisp could be a little crispier but still crisp now the inside although it doesn't have the crunch it has another quality to it which is ultra Ultra Ultra Soft Ultra buttery the honeycomb I think could be more intense but salt levels are good I think it could be a tad sweeter but all that said there were a few issues with it it wasn't very crispy it wasn't quite as Airy as I wanted it to be and truly I love the story and I think this place is a necessity visit for any who goes to Paris just because it's so beautiful but to be the best in Paris I don't know that I can give this above a 6.5 out of 10 for the locals category a lot more to look forward to though our next spot is a bit of a secret it might be the most acclaimed local bakery in all of Paris right across the street from an incredible chocolate manufacturer but there's an important cultural purpose here that makes their proximity that much more special so why the hell does that matter who cares chocolate over here croissants over here so they're making chocolate croissants no we'll get to that in a second the friendch have an entire like culture around like eating the Crome you either eat it for breakfast or F which is a lot of like afternoon snack the best way of course to eat it would be to pair it with a coffee a cup of tea or with of hot chocolates we got our traditional ceson from tar de and just across the screen we have black this is the best way to try your Grant although I'm trying this with the hot chocolate I'm judging the grant as a standalone I just want to see what it's like with the hot chocolate cuz that's tradition here first let's look at this all butter croissant so if you look at the internal structure of this the honeycomb is not really that present it's much more compressed this one is nice it melts in your mouth it still has the crunch that you're looking for they put I think a tiny bit more sugar than the other guys and I actually like that my only complaint would be maybe the crumb structure could be better A lot of people dip it oh my God the chocolate is amazing one of the most layered diverse hot chocolates I've ever had I will say look at the cross-section it's not drawing me in but the butter flavor was huge on this that's the texture left me wanting a lot more and I feel like there are so many other pastries that are buttery as they are so we're looking for a croissant here to me this was like a solid 7 out of 10 in the local category Moving on toir deani but first a brief intermission I'm a big fan of you oh yeah you're also you literally are a big fan Christo Fon is probably the most notorious eair Creator in the world recently when he opened his Cafe he decided to introduce a cresant that it's spanked a little of bit like an eair all of a sudden it's no longer that like simple traditional vienas it turns into a pastry but he also has a classic one so we're going to try that the reinvention will get its own rating and then the classic will be entered in the over overall competition anyway we got a fun fact alert that's right sound the alarms before we get into this you need to understand a lot of people might think all croissant are pastries but that's not necessarily true they're called vieni that word translates to in the style of Vienna It's because according to Adriana croissant only came to life in France in the 1830s when the Cen shaped bread rolls came here from Austria and made it with laminated dough seen in pastries like milfoy and Tartan and Veni only becomes a pastry when sweet focused chefs like Kristoff get creative so he does have a classic one but I'm more interested in these pastries more specifically the raspberry pistachio it's got weight to it very unexpected unbelievable combination the pistachio plus the raspberry now as delicious as it was I did enjoy it it was super overwhelming with all of its flavors I could barely taste the croissant which to me takes some points away flavor-wise honestly an 8.5 out of 10 but overall experience a 7 out of 10 that said we have to try the original crunchy buttery season really well so obviously the di menion category is his own thing but this whole overall competition of the best croissant this one is up there this is a tough one it's delicious it is crispy but it was lacking a little bit of crunch it was lacking a little bit of salt for me I'm going to give it a 7.5 out of 10 still a worthy and far above average croissant this is just the beginning and we're going to see some of the most unusual Innovative croissants I have ever seen in my entire life including one from the most famous pastry chef in the world a lot of people know who they are and there's a lot of scrutiny on what he does we'll get to that in a second moving on to Croissant number nine which is truly one of a kind and I'm not just eating I'm cooking well not really okay so we're at Baner I don't know how to pronounce that I'm sorry you do this Mish so mishak yes the chef's name is Kristoff melak he's one of the most famous chefs in France he makes this pretzel croon which is his signature and it's probably like one of the best prant that you're going to taste on our tour just by looking at it I already want to give Kristof a kiss look he didn't give me any kisses all right I made my own pretzel croissant it's really basic he gave me a strip of laminated dough spiral it into an escargo snail shaped they free seque it bath it in a mixture of water and baking soda and salt top with sesame seeds and bake look at this a pretzel croissant I'm impressed they do not sell normal croissants here they only sell this and Penola I like that kind of behavior that's Rebel mentality it says we're Reinventing this we're doing it the way that we want to do it so we've got the pretzel this is a reinvention it's obviously not a classic and yet it does have a lot of elements of the croissant it's crispy it's well Brown smells like toasted butter but does it taste like a pretzel wo this is my speed right here I've been eating croissants all day when they start tasting the same this brought me back to life it's buttery it's flaky it's Rich it's a little sweet but the crunch you really maximize the crunch without losing the soft inside you get that flavor of the pretzel that toasty flavor what I love the most is the little pops of salt brings it all together it's salty buttery it's very Punchy powerfully flavored this is probably my favorite bite I have had today they managed to capture what makes a croissant great while Reinventing it and making it special it is a reinvention it's not a classic experientially this is a nine bandre melck ties pad's raspberry croissant for first place in our reinvention category they're going to be very hard to beat the next spot we should be honored he is considered to be the Picasso of the renowned macaron so why is he in a croissant video this is Pierre her with the simple black on white just text on the wall logo it screams you know who we are we're going to try a Quon that is made with his signature flavor that he uses for the mcah home called Bahan which is a mix of rose liy and raspberry this is one of the prettiest looking Quon that we've gotten so simple the coloration dried raspberry crumbled on top it's glazed which gives it a totally Unique Look wo so good this is a totally different experience in any croissant we've had all day I might as well try a little bite of this just to compare yeah I'm going to need the whole thing one of the best macaron I've ever had but we're not rating macaron today okay rating Grant overall this might be one of my most favorite grants I've had in my whole life it's glazed with a hard shell exterior just like a glazed dut would be I don't think I've ever seen that before but it makes so much sense it seems so obvious this is how you do a fruit filling super raspberry forward it's sweet like it should be but you don't lose that beautiful buttery flavor of the croissant I've eaten like 40 billion croissants today and I ate half this am I going to regret that physically yes I regret it right now but emotionally I'm happy I did it I'm giving this an almost unheard of immediate 9 out of 10 which leads our star category this might be one of the best sweet croissants I've ever had in my life we're only 10 croissant and sweetheart let's turn the heat up actually maybe I pulled the wrong lever cuz it's fing raining the next location is commonly confused with some Hotel no this is the one and only the Ritz Paris hotel but what's the big deal one of the fathers of culinary helped found this place in 1898 who could it be August escoffier quite literally one of the most important people in food in human history this isn't a joke we're not around here but they're not done he invented mother sauces Brigade systems quisine that will continue to live on forever and they're still going being led by 2024 world's best pastry shop Award winner leire who Chef Francois Pere has one of the most unusual looking croissants I've ever seen and it is all butter I like the practicality of this this is going to be a consistent experience all the way through the quason and also makes it easy to dip good hunting comb structure especially with how small this is this technique creates more surface area for crunch while all retaining that super super soft buttery inside Chef F really likes to call himself a purist we're not far from a traditional like ancestral cant it's just the shape that it's different it's layered nicely it's soft you've got that crisp crunch on the outside slightly sweet not too much this is balanced there's salt in the dough the butter flavor is present it's toasted beautifully what I love about it is the crunch is incredibly consistent and really really good so really it's not a reinvention of the croissant it's just a maximization of the best qualities of a proper one this is might be one of my favorite ones on the whole trip I've been eating croissants all day and this is the first one that is a plain croissant that's actually stopped me in my tracks and made me rethink okay finally I'm getting a new experience while maintaining the original product I could easily eat multiple of these easily a 9.1 out of 10 which makes it our new leader in both the star category and the overall competition for best all butter croissant in Paris I truly believe this is worthy in comparison to the other ones we've had I mean it's just it's unbelievable Moving On We're nine stops in but my mind has been opened in ways I could have never imagined finding one winner it's going to take work sure I might have to eat 30 maybe 40 croissants to do this right but croissants are a lifestyle they're a passion and we will find the number one croissant how are we going to find a winter here when so many of these are so good we judge things on three things texture flavor and appearance each Baker here has their own specialty their own Talent they are all great for different reasons but that doesn't mean we're not going to find the best one moving on we're going to another unexpected one you'll almost never see this in France it's very odd honestly so our next up is called which means Savers natural ingredients we are going to try one of the only sourdough cresant in our selection of cant today well the first thing I noticed was that it smells incredibly good obviously but it smells totally different than any other Quon that we've had let's have Chef Anthony explain it we don't use refine sugar we news honey it's honey from bit this retains the crunch better than the other quason that we've had flavor-wise that buckwheat honey is incredible really special we've had a lot of different Quon they all kind of have a consistent flavor if you're just looking at a plain butter croissant this is the first butter croissant that has almost like a new flavor to it while still maintaining the original flavor that I really like it's almost like a plum like flavor but it's very subtle I love the dedication it's truly a lost art a very strong8 out of 10 which leads our local Legends category I don't know that the ancestral old school way of doing things is what's going to take the win here this is l the Shen's pastry shop and bakery and you can see from the sign outside it says so remember when I told you that the French like to give a words this is a competition really for excellence in the trade of Cuisine he's a pastry chef and a cha so the ceson that we're going to taste here is a cant with chocolates immediately this is one of the butteriest ones I've smelled all day holy moly there's actually a chocolate paste M and you have that like cocoa inside the dough this is interesting because you have everything the cant the P cha because you have the chocolates and a sort of like a version of alond croissant because of like the chocolate cing inside it's like three in one and then the normal one you can see the Honeycombs actually quite nice salt levels are really nice butter very present not greasy nice and even a little bit of sweetness it's a little bit cheerer than what I am looking for in a Quon I don't know I don't know that this is the best one I've had now the reinvention on the other hand I don't know why the dough is so different than the original but it retained the crunch better the flavor of chocolate is unbelievable it's not just inside inside the croissant they made sure that it wrapped all the way around every layer has a little thin band of chocolate dough for the chocolate croissant I'm going to give a solid 7.5 out 10 that takes over second place for our reinventions now for the all butter this one was very tasty but it wasn't for me I don't know something about it just wasn't hitting I think it says 6.3 out of 10 the bar is very high for our next spot Moon I mean that's it I like it I love Simplicity they only make croissant so we might be looking at our winner here what you're going to taste here is a Savory cisson so we're still in the category reinvention but Sav the star of the show it's got ham it has cheese and it smells good I took it off but there was a toothpick with the pickles in it perfect bite the quality of the ham is so nice it's meaty it's not too thin and then the cheese adds a little bit of funk it adds some salt really clean by far this is probably the best ham and cheese croissant I've ever had my life and you have your little pickle to cut the richness let's look at this all butter croissant they're still very crispy they're not dry at all melts in your mouth wonderfully the butter flavor is present the scent sweet not because of sugar but because of good butter the pastry itself really nice ham and cheese comes in at a 7.9 out of 10 that takes over second place for our reinventions and they're all butter croissant and 8 out of 10 great but not our leader so our next stop is called it was opened by Kristoff vess more than a decade ago he's definitely the pioneer of modern bakeries even though it's a very like nicely decorated late 19th century Bakery and we're going to taste what they call the authentic cessant the one we're really here for the classic butter croissant can you tell us why this is the authentic because of the process in France now what is only 15% of craft bakeries still make quasa themselves 85% is industrially processed when you do it yourself it has to be at least a 2 days process because a dough has to age for at least 24 hours that fermentation brings extra flavor earlier we were going to bring out the fresh Quon and he said don't do the fresh one cuz it's easy for a fresh Quon to be good and he got an old one cuz he's like it's that good and I got to say it's really really good this is the most tender melt in your mouth cron we've had on the trip it's got the classic flavor that you're EXP and you get the age off the dough thank you very much I appreciate authenticity and doing things the old school way a powerful eight out of 10 in Our Stars category but like I said I don't know that the old school methods are going to be our winner there's a reason that people keep Reinventing and pushing the boundaries next we have paye we're seeing unique flavors being infused in these like black sesame from Chef Alice Lynn this is a very rare and unusual croissant what we have here it's a black sesame cream on top and black sesame ganache and you have a very good example of a Franco Asian Pressel even their normal croissant looks really beautiful and it smells very buttery and yeasty which I like a lot the inside is honestly the Highlight the inside is so like stretchy and moist and chewy it's a little sweeter too but I like it it's very nice okay so this is the heaviest croissant I have ever held in my life because it's full of black sesame cream I don't even know how to eat this this is going to be messy yeah it might be messy it looks cool but this is very unpractical wo I love sesame it adds a rich nuttiness that I think really plays well with theist croissant Super Rich super creamy and not overly sweet honestly quite light considering there's probably I don't know 1,000 calories in that one croissant I got to say when I comes to a croissant I prefer simple there's a lot going on here I think one bite and I'm happy I don't want anymore the cant itself is very nice I would not come here for this I would come here for the black sesame croissant and I would share it with maybe two or three people this is unique because it's got that toasted sesame and I think that's what really makes this special and worth the trip the black sesame comes in at a 7.5 out of 10 for reinvention in the classic croissant a solid 7.5 out of 10 for the overall competition delicious above average but I'm looking for a little bit more that said we're moving on you see this place it looks very unsuspecting the giant trash can out front it just kind of Blends him with everything you may have no idea that this croissant may be our overall winner maon ducet this is the number one croissant in Paris they won that in 2024 I'm actually kind of surprised you could easily walk past us and have no clue you're walking past possibly one of the greatest croissants of all time and we're about to try it the stakes are high can they overtake our current leader Ritz ltoa they're going to have to be better than a 9.1 which is extremely difficult on my scale usually smell test impeccable it's like 50% butter in your face 50% that nice sort of almost alcoholic fermentation of bread scent I'm going to start with the crispy n first completely different texturally than pretty much any of the other Quon that we had it's got almost like a Brey chew I love that they were able to maintain that and still have this nice flaky Airy inside a lot of time when dos are chewier it means that they're lower hydration they're more worked it's much harder harder to create these beautiful layers and they managed to maintain that the dough is seasoned perfectly with salt honeycomb is nice it does melt in your mouth after you've chewed it for a while I do wish this was crispier but the parts that I did eat that were crispy were very nice I think this is up there in terms of quality with many of the other ones we've had is it the best one in Paris still this is a hard decision but I got to be honest I was really confused it was good and far above average for sure but the best listen I got a warm croissant it was crisp but I'm going to give this an8 out of 10 which means Ritz Lamar is still our overall leader but that doesn't mean they can't be dethroned our next spot I'm excited about because the grant that they presented me with was so perfectly shaped surely it's equally as good as it looks we're in the kitchen of the newest Bakery in town called lab benua is definitely a local spot and I love this guys I think that everything that they do is perfectly executed with a lot of flavor this is exactly how I think aone should look starts thick and it tapers perfectly boom boom like a stair step all the way down even on both sides even the tails are almost identical in size the layering is very distinct the Browning it's dark the bottom dark and then of course there's that nice sort of age on the dough you can smell the fermentation on it the overall flavor is even butter even fermentation I really like this croissant I definitely would put this on my go-to list this is an excellent croissant but it wasn't quite as wispy crispy immediately melt in your mouth a little too chewy the flavors were there it was nice a great croissant I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 we move on to fra you see this one I wouldn't have even thought there was was a croissant here except they have the craziest reinvention I've seen it is quite literally a croissant that they've then hollowed into a cup filled with hot chocolate and topped with whipped cream I mean honestly this might win reinvention so there are a lot of bakeries in Paris that have taken the croissant to another level prep is one of them I've never seen this before I think it's very Innovative and fun you get multiple experiences you get the hot chocolate eating experience once you're done with the hot chocolate got a little whipped cream but if you split it open you still got hot chocolate on the inside then you get to eat your cup oh it's really good you're getting two kinds of chocolate you're getting semi soft solid chocolate on the inside but then you have that nice light hot chocolate kind of combining with that creating its own unique texture the crunch from me outside is caramelized a little bit sweet a little bit salty definitely this is a Indulgence the venois on the croissant was really really really good but the chocolate's so overwhelming you don't really get to love and enjoy that beautiful croissant I see the croissant itself an 8 out of 10 but the two combined turned it into a 7 out of 10 for me one of the more unique experiences we've had thus far we have many more to go moving on next up is Tik tok's Global most famous croissant in human history the crookie invented by Chef Stefan louard look how cute he is come on and is Artisan Bakery maon louard it's a beautiful Union of chocolate chip cookie and properly made croissant you can imagine the French seeing this in their brains probably just about floated into the air and exploded like a firework on 4th of July cuz this is almost like a disrespect the traditionality but you guys know I like that and thanks to Tik Tok they now sell up to 3,000 of these a day so so whether you think it's a gimmick or not we're tasting it to see where it lands wow it's so balanced it's not overbearing obviously the croissant is excellent as it is but the cookie is kind of an important element here it's half the flavor and they made a dough that is buttery but it's not overly buttery and it's actually not very sweet it is sweet but not like a typical chocolate chip cookie what an American thinks of like a cookie they think very sweet sort of chocolate and that's kind of it what really makes the shine it's not the normal chocolate chip you're getting chocolate notes that are fruity there's floral notes mixed in with this cookie it's beautifully simple it's under understandable by all anyone can enjoy this this was unbelievable also chocolate chip cookies Happ to be one of my favorite desserts of all time wow this blew my mind truly it felt brand new yet familiar while being extremely exciting to eat it was intense with the cookie flavor but you didn't lose the beauty of the croissant behind the cookie I love the fact that they didn't give up quality they used the highest quality chocolate on Earth they took a cookie turned it to the maximum using the best ingredients in the world made a beautifully traditional properly executed croissant and combined the two so much layering of work here no pun on the layers by the way this earns a potentially insurmountable 9.1 out of 10 making it our new reinvention leader well earned we are a lot of croissants in but we might have our reinvention winner except there's one last one that could Dethrone it the margarita croissant at Bri yes uh Margarita like pizza but croissant oh I love that you're now transitioning to a totally different flavor you would never expect to be with a croissant and it works really well obviously you have that buttery Rich flaky croissant but you also have this nice tartness from the Tom sauce that helps cut the richness the freshness from the mozzarella which just adds more depth to the overall flavor I actually usually don't like oregano on pizza but it works really well here because I think you have that to add some more freshness to the overall flavor that's already so rich this is a really well executed Savory reinvention might be my favorite we'll find out if you had to choose between a ceso margarita and a pizza margarita the Italians are watching they really are mastering the reinvention here I mean this is truly like a new experience both visually and taste wise the final decision for our reinvention category Misan louvar crookie leads with a 9.1 so we're going to need a minimum of a 9.2 which I've given very few of those in my life but the margarita was a big surprise with an 8.9 out of 10 very delicious I'll definitely be going back that means maon louard officially wins our reinvention category putting that one to a close with a 9.1 it's hard to ignore the marriage of a perfectly baked chocolate chip cookie with some of the world's finest chocolate on a properly produced croissant now we need to finish our ultimate Quest we currently have ritzz comto our as our lead for best overall croissant at 9.1 and it really impressed me truly but we're moving on to something that could possibly Dethrone it the most anticipated Bakery SL pastry shop possibly in the world Cedric gret he might be the biggest name in pastry that we've ever seen so surely his croissant will live up right the honeycomb structure on the inside looks immaculate I smell the butter it's not as buttery as I expected and for some reason like it's not as crisp as I thought it would be for fresh fresh baked we had older ones that were crispier than this as for the shapes I think this is really sort of like a new wave of creso making just like tiny and round the weird thing is I'm not tasting that much butter it does taste good like this is a good croissant it is seasoned nicely I like Cedric gillet I think the work he's doing is beautiful I've always had respect for the stuff that he's done that said I'm a little bit underwhelmed and maybe it's because I was so excited to get it one of the most beautiful croissants I think we have seen But the flavor doesn't match it I mean I'm sure his pastries are absolutely excellent it's just we're here for croissants and I will say that if you go into that shop 75% of the shop is filled with fresh baked croissants not pastry which tells me that they're selling a lot of croissants that means that that's a big part of their business ultimately my goal is to recommend you the very best croissant SL croissants that you can find in Paris is it worth it to wait in the rain or wait in general in a very very long line for this croissant I feel that I would rather steer you a different direction to hopefully some of the other higher rated ones but if you did want to sit in that line you probably want to wait for the pastries right now to prove this point let's try the P cream and chocolate filed penu for comparison way better than the pl croissant the plain croissant doesn't stand really that well on its own two legs when you look at it it looks like a 10 out of 10 but when you taste it it's closer to like a six 6 and 1/2 maybe but this is immaculate so let's move on so wait if cetric grle can't win this and we have a lead then we can only give a winner one more chance a local Legend named bom and they're doing something Unthinkable with a croissant everything a traditional all butter croissant should have so what's the real difference this is our our final spot she's brought me here to buom which comes from bong and this is a bakery and buin that was opened by julan du another very famous chef and a former Top Chef candidate and you are going to taste the cubic cresant like a square cresant you want to take the first one oh wow oh my God it's crisp it's so light it's like I don't even know where to begin wo this is like the best of every World texturally literally perfect not just because is crunchy this is very light it's crisp it immediately melts in your mouth the crisp exterior and then the inside is so light so fluffy the butter perfumes your whole mouth in an amazing way cuz there's so much air in here it's not so light that it totally melts you have some time to chew so it has both the tenderness but also The Chew that I like it has the flavor and both the airiness that I like it's also seasoned really well the salt level I've eaten 10 20 30 40 pissants this one I'm almost done look how much I ate if I want to eat this much of this is really excellent I mean it's beyond good honestly impeccable work really truly excellent thank you very much it's perfect you're talking about me or the our final spot but I have a really hard decision is this traditional croissant but in the shape of a cube really going to be worthy of even a Podium spot I mean they're going out on a limb here all the passion the creativity and a lot of butter I've experienced today it all comes down to this we've visited over 20 places saying many of them were great slight differentiations this not only being the last last stop but it is the stop that made me stop in my tracks it doesn't really matter to me the shape honestly I think that this is the best croissant I've had period borderline a reinvention but It ultimately was just a different shape which ended up leveraging all of the greatest qualities of a croissant putting our final spot as the ultimate winner with a 9.3 out of 10 an almost unheard of ranking something I very rarely give this means buom also takes the local Legends Crown the crookie at maon louard wins the reinvention category over Baner melac with their pretzel croissant imp pad's raspberry croissant all incredible impeccable bites of food and winning by only a few points so you know they're hypothetically all worth visiting and of course our winner for the star category Ritz lamto with franois Pere with this tubular all butter croissant I want to be really clear here I've been eating croissants all day I don't want to eat them anymore and this being the last one I was still excited to eat after probably what was 3 to 4 lbs of butter and dough in my body to me that deserves the win all the places were wonderful and you should visit as many as you can I would not recommend doing what I did I don't feel good but I would come back here no matter how I felt because this goes at my number one spot comparison to everywhere else we went so come visit Paris this should probably be your first stop and check out the other places along the way and I also want to give a big shout out to Adriana and eating Europe they were the ones that made this whole tour possible they helped assemble all these places for us they do trips all over Europe and so if you want to join them be sure to check them out we'll have a link in the description if you want to go if you're visiting Paris they're doing a breakfast tour bye love you subscribe why did it take this this long to find the best one why couldn't we have found it sooner what's the story behind this who's heart got broken in Paris oh well anyway\""
